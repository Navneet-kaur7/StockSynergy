# **StockSynergy**

📈 **Predict, Analyze, and Visualize Stock Prices Using ARIMA and Python**

StockSynergy is a Python-based analytical tool that fetches historical stock prices, visualizes trends, analyzes data, and predicts future prices using ARIMA models. It assists in understanding stock behavior and making data-driven predictions for investment insights and project learning.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

✅ Fetch historical stock price data using **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)**.
✅ Visualize price trends, differencing, and autocorrelation.
✅ Train an **ARIMA model** for time series forecasting.
✅ Predict future stock prices for the **next 10 business days**.
✅ Evaluate performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **SMAPE**.
✅ Generate clean, interactive plots for insights.
✅ Fully beginner-friendly, clean, and well-structured code.

---

## 🛠️ **Installation**

1️⃣ **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StockSynergy.git
cd StockSynergy
```

2️⃣ **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance statsmodels scikit-learn
```

Or, inside Jupyter/Colab:

```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance statsmodels scikit-learn
```

---

## 🧩 **Usage**

Run the script directly:

```bash
python stocksynergy.py
```

You will be prompted for:

* **Stock ticker:** e.g., `AAPL` (Apple) or `RELIANCE.NS` (Reliance Industries).
* **Start date:** Format `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g., `2022-01-01`.
* **End date:** Format `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g., `2023-01-01`.

The script will:
✅ Fetch and display historical data.
✅ Show descriptive statistics.
✅ Visualize trends and autocorrelations.
✅ Train ARIMA and generate price predictions with plots.
✅ Predict the next 10 business days' prices with visualization.

---

## 📊 **Sample Output**

* Time series plot of historical prices.
* Differencing plots to visualize stationarity.
* Lag plots for autocorrelation analysis.
* ARIMA predictions vs. actual price plots.
* Future 10-day price forecasts with clear indicators.

---

## ⚡ **Example**

```plaintext
Enter the stock ticker (e.g., AAPL): AAPL
Enter the start date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2023-01-01
Enter the end date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2024-01-01

First few rows of the data:
...

Testing Mean Squared Error: 5.234
Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 2.432

Predicted prices for the next 10 days:
...
```

## 📚 **Technologies Used**

* **Python**: Core programming.
* **yfinance**: Fetching live stock data.
* **pandas, numpy**: Data manipulation.
* **matplotlib, seaborn**: Visualization.
* **statsmodels (ARIMA)**: Time-series forecasting.
* **scikit-learn**: Evaluation metrics.

## 🚩 **Project Ideas for Extension**

✅ Add **hyperparameter tuning** for ARIMA using AIC/BIC optimization.
✅ Integrate **Prophet** for alternative forecasting.
✅ Develop a **Flask/Streamlit web app** for interactive usage.
✅ Add **technical indicators (RSI, MACD)** for feature-rich insights.
✅ Enable **backtesting with investment strategies**.
